# GeoFS-Autoland

---

Why was this made? To answer that question. Well well well. Ever felt how badly GeoFS A/P lands? Well this addon fixes that just like IRL. IRL it's not like what you can see in GeoFS without this addon.


***Achieve consistent, stable, and smooth touchdowns every time. Say goodbye to bouncing and unstable final approaches!***
Improves the ILS autoland system by adding flaring functionality and autobrakes/spoilers/reverse thrust. Also disconnects upon ground contact.
To use: Set up a normal ILS approach with the built-in autopilot and the addon will automatically activate.

## Compatibility and Limitations


Please read these points to understand the addon's operational philosophy before reporting issues.


### Aircraft Compatibility* **Non-Autoland Aircraft:** If an aircraft does not have real-world Autoland capability (e.g., small GA planes), results may be poor or unstable. For realism, **we cannot fix issues like those. Sorry.*** 

**Autoland-Equipped Aircraft:** If an aircraft *is* known to have Autoland capability in real life and this addon performs poorly, please report it! We will investigate and fix the system to match the expected performance.


### Crosswind Performance

* **Do not always expect a 'butter' landing** in high winds. Just like in real life, the system has limits.

* For example, aircraft like the **Concorde** have strict crosswind limitations (typically **15–25 knots**). Attempting Autoland above the aircraft's physical limitations will result in an unstable landing.
