# GeoFS-Autoland
* If you try this addon with all aircrafts and there's an aircraft it didn't land well, properly, or smoothly with it. That's normal if the used aircraft doesn't actually have Autoland IRL. If it does. Please contact us about it and we'll fix the issue.
* Please do NOT always expect a butter landing if the plane can't handle 40 knots for example the Concorde. It only can handle 15-25 knots of crosswind.
